                    <p>Greymon is a Dinosaur Digimon. Greymon's cranial skin has hardened so that it is covered in a rhinoceros beetle-like shell. It is an extremely aggressive Digimon, with a body like a lethal weapon covered in sharp claws and gigantic horns. However, it is highly intelligent, and if you're able to tame it then there probably isn't any monster as strong.[9]

                        Nova Blast[10] (Mega Flame): Spews ultra-high-temperature flames or a flame shot from its mouth to reduce everything to ashes.

                    <p>MetalGreymon (Vaccine) is a Cyborg Digimon. It has mechanized more than half of its body, incorporating technology appropriated from Andromon.[15] The MetalGreymon of Folder Continent are Cyborg Digimon that succeed in perfectly digivolving from Greymon,[16] and draw out a stronger power which cannot be compared with those of File Island.[17] In order to digivolve to MetalGreymon, it must fight its way through and defeat the formidable opponents who come against it. Also, MetalGreymon's offensive power is said to equal that of a single nuclear warhead, and if the likes of a low-level Digimon suffered that blow, it would be annihilated without leaving a trace. Its "Trident Arm" is made from enhanced Chrome Digizoid.[18]

                        Attacks
                        
                        Mega Claw[19] (Trident Arm): Launches its tethered Trident Arm to slash or wrap up enemies.
                        Giga Blaster[20] (Giga Destroyer): Fires organic missiles from the hatch on part of its chest.
                        Metal Arm
                        Metal Slash: Slashes with its claw.
                        Terra Destroyer (Tera Destroyer): Launches an enhanced version of its "Giga Blaster" attack.
                        Metal Slash II (メタルスラッシュ改 Metal Slash Kai?, lit. "Metal Slash Revision"): Slashes with its claw.
                        Powerful Flame (Overflame): Unleashes a wave of fire from its claw. In Digimon Adventure (PSP) and Digimon New Century it breaths fire from its mouth.
                        Body Blow
                        Giga Storm: Sends out a high-temperature energy wave from the firing ports on its chest.

                        WarGreymon is a Dragon Digimon. The strongest dragon warrior whose body is clad in armor of the super-metal "Chrome Digizoid", it is the ultimate form of Greymon-species Digimon. Though it differs from the gigantic figure seen in Greymon-species Digimon, and has the form of a Man-type, it has rapidly improved its speed and power, and it is likely impossible to defeat it with the attacks of an Ultimate Digimon. The "Dramon Destroyers" (Dramon Killers) equipped to both of its arms exhibit immense power against Dramon-species Digimon, while simultaneously being double-edged swords that put its own life at great risk. Also, when the shells equipped on its back unite into one, they become the "Brave Shield", which is a shield of the strongest toughness. It is said that the moment that a true hero among veteran warriors awakens to its own mission, it digivolves into WarGreymon.[12]
